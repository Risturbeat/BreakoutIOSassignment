# BreakoutIOSassignment

There are not many commits on this repository even though we committed quite a bit during the process.
However we had problems with GIT and we had to create a new repo, which as you can see sort of solved our problem.
The only thing is, all DaniÃ«ls projects are now in this repo as well.
The Breakout_Bram_Daniel folders are the correct folders
